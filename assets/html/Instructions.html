    <h3>Playing</h3>
    <p>There are four 10 x 10 grids used in this game, such that each player has access to two of their own. The squares on the grids are identified by a letter on the vertical axis (A to J) and a number on the horizontal axis (1 to 10). One grid of each player is used to arrange their ships on and show the opponent’s shots. The other tracking grid is used for their own shots directed to the opponent. </p>
    <h3>Setup Phase</h3>
    <p>The game begins with an initial setup phase. During this time, each player secretly positions all five of their ships of varying sizes onto a 10 by 10 ship grid. These consist of an aircraft carrier that takes up five consecutive squares, a battleship of four squares, a submarine and destroyer/cruiser of three squares, and finally a patrol boat of two squares. Each can be positioned either horizontally or vertically within the grid, and they cannot overlap. </p>
    <h3>Shooting</h3>
    <p>After the initial setup, the game progresses with players taking turns to shoot at each other by selecting a square on the opponent’s grid of ships. The opponent’s grid is marked with either a hit or miss for that square, and the attackers tracking grid is also marked appropriately. On the event of a hit, the attacker has another go at shooting. In addition to this, when all the squares occupied by a ship are bombarded, the ship is sunk and revealed to the attacker. The first player to sink the opponent’s ships is the winner.</p>
